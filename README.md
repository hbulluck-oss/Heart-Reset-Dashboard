## 📊 Scoring Methodology

### Calibrated Risk Scoring
- **Dynamic Denominator**: Maximum possible points adapt based on individual circumstances
- **Lipid Contribution Cap**: Total lipid scoring capped at 60 points (prevents single factor dominance)
- **Lifestyle Soft Cap**: Lifestyle factors capped at 60 points collectively
- **Weighted Factors**: Clinical significance determines point allocation

### Non-Modifiable vs Modifiable Factors
The assessment clearly distinguishes between:
- **Non-Modifiable**: Age, ethnicity, family history (awareness factors)
- **Modifiable**: Blood pressure, cholesterol, lifestyle choices (actionable factors)

### Traffic Light Thresholds
- **Green (<20%)**: Low cardiovascular load - optimization focus
- **Amber (20-40%)**: Accumulating risk - intervention beneficial
- **Red (≥40%)**: High cardiovascular load - medical evaluation recommended
- **Grey**: Indeterminate due to missing critical parameters

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

- Thresholds calibrated for European populations
- May require adjustment for different demographics

### Limitations
- Not a diagnostic tool
- Does not replace medical consultation
- Simplified scoring vs. clinical risk calculators (e.g., QRISK, Framingham)
- Does not predict absolute risk of cardiovascular events

### When to Seek Medical Attention
**Immediate**: Chest pain, severe breathlessness, acute symptoms
**Urgent**: Red risk category, multiple high-risk factors
**Recommended**: Amber risk category, any concerns
